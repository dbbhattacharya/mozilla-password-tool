USAGE
====
This tool allows you to view the passwords stored by
Mozilla/Firefox. It also allows you to encrypt/decrypt the password
store (so that the master password is required/not required for
access)


INSTALLATION
============
If you have pyrex (<URL:http://nz.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/>) 
installed, you should use distutils to install, just do

python setup.py install

and you should be all set (although you may of course need to modify
sys.path if you use --prefix to install to a non-standard place).

If you do not have pyrex, things become a little more complicated, I
supply the source created by pyrex, and it should be possible to
compile manually (most likely by running

gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -O3 -fPIC -IPYTHONPATH -shared -lnss3 -o nss.so nss.c

where PYTHONPATH is probably /usr/include/python2.3 or similar). After
that, you have to copy the extension to your site-packages directory and
copy mozpass to where you want it manually.

BUGS
====
Bugs can be reported to pont_mozpass_bugs@soua.net.

For reasons of simplicity, I use a hand-hacked header file instead of
requiring the installation of NSS headers. As the supplied file is
overly simplistic, it does place an additional requirement on the ABI
used (who is responsible for adjusting the stack if parameters are
passed on the stack). I haven't seen a system where that becomes a
problem, though.
